ReelRadio
=========

This is a project I made when I was in college. The scope of the project was
to build web application for the local university's student radio, so students
could listen to the broadcast on their laptops or phones.

It was originally made on Rails 3, I've recently decided to port it to Rails 6
and give it a bit of polish.

This was my very first Ruby on Rails solo project (outside of work).
